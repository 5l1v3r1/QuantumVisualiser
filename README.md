An Interactive Model To Show How A Quantum Computer Can Break RSA Encryption

Due to the complicated nature of a quantum computer, it is often difficult to understand how one works. This project attempts to address this issue by simulating one. This interactive model shows the individual steps of breaking RSA using a quantum period finding algorithm. The model can also factor the multiple of two prime numbers.

The application can be started by running src/view/MainFrame.java
